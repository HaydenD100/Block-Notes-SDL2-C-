# Block-Notes-SDL2-C-
Just a simple SDL2 c++ project I worked on too get a grasp on the concepts of SDL2 and SDL Mixer 

The blocks all move from right to left with different velocities and when they collide with the edge of the window the block switches directions and plays and musical note 

Here are some images of the SDL noteblock Project running at different times
